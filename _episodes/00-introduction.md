## What is data analysis?

## What are the typical steps involved with public health data analysis?


## Reasons for using R versus other statistical software

- Expensive licenses, proprietary formats -- do these go against the ideas of reproducible (& collaborative) sceince?  Do these exclude scientists in parts of the world and/or institutions with less funding?
- versus other open-source options (e.g. Python).   Depends what people in your field are using.  What are people in Public Health using?   Best might be to learn multiple tools and get a feel for what to reach for for a given problem.  Good for different problems and for being able to participate in a wider range of projects.
- what else?

### Bring in the "reproducible science" paper and follow the main points through the lesson.  Bring them in here.
