## Introduction goes here

Histograms

Looking for null values

some basic filtering - for example, filter just to women of childbearing age, check for % of NA to pregnancy question

Checking normality of continuous 

Data cleanliness - boxplots, look for outliers





We can start to ask questions like:  How many women in this data set have diabetes?  For categorical data, the `table()` function is quite handy.


~~~
table(swan_df$DIABETE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

    1     2 
15018  1060 
~~~
{: .output}

If we wanted these proportions as percentages, we can take the result of `table()` and apply the `prop.table()` function:

~~~
prop.table(table(swan_df$DIABETE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

        1         2 
0.9340714 0.0659286

Contingency table between osteoporosis and arthritis - #TODO Need some words here

table(swan_df$ARTHRIT, swan_df$OSTEOPR)
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Doing it with `with()`

HEART = "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you had a heart attack or angina?"
MHEART = "Are you currently taking heart medication?"
ARTHRIT = "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have arthritis?"
MARTHR = "Are you currently taking medication for arthritis?"
HIGH_BP
AGE
PHY_ACT = 
SMOKE_R = "Do you smoke cigarettes now?"
MEN_OPT = "Do you think you are: (1) Without any sign of menopause (2) Just beginning menopause (3) In the middle (4) Near the end (5) All through (-8) Don't know (.) Missing"
BMI
