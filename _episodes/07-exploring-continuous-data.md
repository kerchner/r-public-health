# Continuous Variables and Linear Regression

#TODO:  Better wording

To perform an analysis that assesses whether one or more predictor variables might explain a response or outcome variable, we need to check whether the data meets certain assumptions if we'd like to use linear regression to prove our hypothesis about the relationship between the predictors and the outcome.

The assumptions that the data must meet in order to build a valid linear regression model are:
1. A linear relationship between each continuous predictor (X), and the outcome variable (Y)
2. Each continuous predictor has a normal distribution
3. No collinearity between predictors
4. No auto-correlation (residuals are not related to each other)
5. Homoscedasticity (no pattern in the residuals)

In this episode, we'll be using R to investigate these assumptions.

# Checking normality

## Getting to know our data

One of the first ways to start getting to know our data is to get some basic statistics.  Let's see what the `summary()` function does:

We see that in addition to calculating mean, median, minimum, maximum, and the 1st and 3rd quartiles for each variable, `summary()` also includes a tally of the number of `NA`s in each variable.

Not only does this give us a quick sense for the range of values for each variable, it can also give us a clue as to problems in the data.

## Computing individual statistics

#TODO: Use of mean(), stdev() etc.


## Visualizations of single variables

Even though some of our variables aren't really continuous (we'll deal with those soon), we can start looking at the continuous variables.

Visualizations of single variables might include histograms, boxplots, or other types of plots.

Let's take a look at the DBP (diastolic blood pressure) of the subjects in our data.

A basic histogram, created with `hist()` with no optional parameters, gives us a starting point:


~~~
hist(analysis_swan_df$DBP)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

What are some of the parameters we can control?  We can learn more about `hist()` either by typing `?hist` at the Console, or by searching for it using the search bar in the Help pane.

The help documentation includes a "default" method that shows not only the possible parameters we might use, but also their default values if we don't override them:

```
## Default S3 method:
hist(x, breaks = "Sturges",
     freq = NULL, probability = !freq,
     include.lowest = TRUE, right = TRUE,
     density = NULL, angle = 45, col = NULL, border = NULL,
     main = paste("Histogram of" , xname),
     xlim = range(breaks), ylim = NULL,
     xlab = xname, ylab,
     axes = TRUE, plot = TRUE, labels = FALSE,
     nclass = NULL, warn.unused = TRUE, ...)
```

We can read further to learn about how to use each of the parameters.  For example, if we wanted to control the breakpoints between the bins, we can specify a value for the `breaks` parameter:

```
breaks    one of:

          * a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells,
          * a function to compute the vector of breakpoints,
          * a single number giving the number of cells for the histogram,
          * a character string naming an algorithm to compute the number of cells (see ‘Details’),
          * a function to compute the number of cells.
```

Let's try passing `hist()` a single number giving the number of cells or bins:


~~~
hist(analysis_swan_df$DBP, breaks = 50)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

#TODO: Consider other parameters

#TODO: Show horizontal


~~~
boxplot(analysis_swan_df$Glucose)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

# Plotting the relationship between two continuous variables

We would now like to verify that any relationship between each X and Y is roughly linear.  We can use the `plot()` function in R to quickly create a scatterplot.


~~~
plot(y = analysis_swan_df$Glucose, x = analysis_swan_df$BMI)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


In this case, we see there may be some outliers where Glucose levels are high.  Given that a glucose level of over 126 mg/dL is considered Type II Diabetic, we can take a look at the scatterplot with those data excluded.

We'll make a subset, then redraw the scatterplot:


~~~
swan_non_diabetic <- analysis_swan_df %>% filter(Glucose < 126)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in analysis_swan_df %>% filter(Glucose < 126): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
plot(y = swan_non_diabetic$Glucose, x = swan_non_diabetic$BMI)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in plot(y = swan_non_diabetic$Glucose, x = swan_non_diabetic$BMI): object 'swan_non_diabetic' not found
~~~
{: .error}




Looking for null values

some basic filtering - for example, filter just to women of childbearing age, check for % of NA to pregnancy question

Checking normality of continuous 

Data cleanliness - boxplots, look for outliers
