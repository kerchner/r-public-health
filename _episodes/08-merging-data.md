## Combining data from multiple files

Often, the observations of the study participants may be distributed across many different data files.  For example, one file might contain a table with demographics, with one row per participant.  Another file might contain laboratory measurements for some or all of those participants.

To perform your analysis, though, you probably want all of the demographics and laboratory data of interest in a single table which has one row for each participant.

In order to do this, first we'll need to load each of the separate data files into data.frame objects in R.  Once we've done that, we'll be able to use R functions to combine them.

First, let's get the libraries/packages we'll need:



~~~
library(SASxport)
library(tidyverse)
library(survey) # for using survey weights
# survey::svydesign, svymean, svyglm
library(jtools) # for svycor
~~~
{: .language-r}

## A word about packages -- interpreting warnings, masking, and more

Notice that when you ran `library(tidyverse)`, some warnings showed up on the console.  The red Xs might have made you think something went wrong!

Let's break that part of the output down a bit:

TODO: Replace with screenshot or figure out how to colorize text: 
~~~
── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
~~~

This is telling us that two functions, `filter()` and `log()` from the `dplyr` package **masked** two functions with the same names in the `stats` package, which is always available in R (you don't need to run `install.packages` or `library` to use it).  By **masking**, this means that if you have code that uses the `filter()` function, R is going to give precedence to the package you installed later, and R will assume you meant `filter()` from `dplyr`.

Now what if you still want to use `filter()` from `stats`?  Well, there's a hint in the output above.  You can call it by being more explicit and including the package name, referencing it as `stats::filter()`.

You might also be wondering: But I thought I installed `tidyverse`, not `dplyr`!  Packages can have **dependencies**, meaning that one package needs, or depends on, another.  In this case, `tidyverse` has several dependencies, one of which is `dplyr`, so when you install `tidyverse`, several other packages are installed with it:  `dplyr`, `magrittr`, `ggplot2`, and others.  You definitely _can_ just install the ones you want, instead of the `tidyverse` package which brings all of them in.


~~~
# Demographics data file
demographics <- read.xport('data/DEMO_I.XPT')

# Laboratory data files
bmi_df <- read.xport('data/BMX_I.XPT') 
bp_df <- read.xport('data/BPX_I.XPT')
cbc_df <- read.xport('data/CBC_I.XPT')
glu_df <- read.xport('data/GLU_I.XPT')
tg_df <- read.xport('data/TRIGLY_I.XPT')

tc_df <- read.xport('data/TCHOL_I.XPT')
# smk_df <- read.xport('data/SMQ_I.XPT')
~~~
{: .language-r}

Let's take a quick look at the variables in the demographics file:

~~~
colnames(demographics)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] "SEQN"     "SDDSRVYR" "RIDSTATR" "RIAGENDR" "RIDAGEYR" "RIDAGEMN"
 [7] "RIDRETH1" "RIDRETH3" "RIDEXMON" "RIDEXAGM" "DMQMILIZ" "DMQADFC" 
[13] "DMDBORN4" "DMDCITZN" "DMDYRSUS" "DMDEDUC3" "DMDEDUC2" "DMDMARTL"
[19] "RIDEXPRG" "SIALANG"  "SIAPROXY" "SIAINTRP" "FIALANG"  "FIAPROXY"
[25] "FIAINTRP" "MIALANG"  "MIAPROXY" "MIAINTRP" "AIALANGA" "DMDHHSIZ"
[31] "DMDFMSIZ" "DMDHHSZA" "DMDHHSZB" "DMDHHSZE" "DMDHRGND" "DMDHRAGE"
[37] "DMDHRBR4" "DMDHREDU" "DMDHRMAR" "DMDHSEDU" "WTINT2YR" "WTMEC2YR"
[43] "SDMVPSU"  "SDMVSTRA" "INDHHIN2" "INDFMIN2" "INDFMPIR"
~~~
{: .output}

And now let's take a quick look at one of the other files to see which variables are in it:

~~~
colnames(bmi_df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] "SEQN"     "BMDSTATS" "BMXWT"    "BMIWT"    "BMXRECUM" "BMIRECUM"
 [7] "BMXHEAD"  "BMIHEAD"  "BMXHT"    "BMIHT"    "BMXBMI"   "BMDBMIC" 
[13] "BMXLEG"   "BMILEG"   "BMXARML"  "BMIARML"  "BMXARMC"  "BMIARMC" 
[19] "BMXWAIST" "BMIWAIST" "BMXSAD1"  "BMXSAD2"  "BMXSAD3"  "BMXSAD4" 
[25] "BMDAVSAD" "BMDSADCM"
~~~
{: .output}

While it's great that the study measured 25 variables for each participant (idenfied by their SEQN value), we'll end up with a lot of varibles that we don't need for our analysis if we merge the entire table and all of its variables onto our demographics data.  Sometimes you want to keep all of the variables, but many times you only want some.


Now that we have all the files read in, let's merge.



From bmi_df we are keeping: BMXBMI
from bp_df: PBXPLS (pules), BPXSY1 (SBP), PBXDI1 (DPB),
tg_df : LBXTR (triglycerides mg/dL), LBDLDL (LDL mg/dL)
tc_df: LBXTC (total chol mg/dL)
hdl_df: LBDHDD (HDL mg/dL)
cbc_df: LBXWBCSI (WBCs 1000cells/uL)
glu_df: LBXGLU (glucose fasting mg/dL)

HERE WE NEED TO CONSIDER DPLYR FOR JOINING. #TODO


~~~
merge_df <- merge(demographics, bmi_df[ ,c("SEQN", "BMXBMI")])
merge_df <- merge (merge_df, bp_df[ ,c("SEQN", "BPXSY1", "BPXDI1")])
merge_df <- merge(merge_df, tg_df[ , c("SEQN", "LBXTR", "LBDLDL", "WTSAF2YR")])
merge_df <- merge(merge_df, tc_df[ , c("SEQN", "LBXTC")])
merge_df <- merge(merge_df, hdl_df[ , c("SEQN", "LBDHDD")])
merge_df <- merge(merge_df, cbc_df[ , c("SEQN", "LBXWBCSI")])
merge_df <- merge(merge_df, glu_df[ , c("SEQN", "LBXGLU")])
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
write.csv(merge_df, file = 'data_out/merge.csv', row.names = FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Import the merge_df so we don't have to merge everytime.

~~~
merge_df <- read.csv("data_out/merge.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Select variables of interest only.  This also have sampling weight vars.

~~~
merge_df <- merge_df %>% select(SEQN, BMXBMI, RIDAGEYR, BPXSY1, BPXDI1, LBDLDL, LBXTC, LBDHDD, LBXGLU, WTSAF2YR,  SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA) # WTINT2YR, WTMEC2YR --> not using these 2 weigths.  Instead we are using WTSAF2YR b/c it belongs to the smallest subset.
# see: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/module3.aspx
~~~
{: .language-r}

Weights: Use "svydesign" to assign the weights

~~~
tg_design <- svydesign(id = ~SDMVPSU,
                      strata = ~SDMVSTRA,
                      weights = ~WTSAF2YR, 
                      nest = TRUE,
                      data = merge_df)
# The svydesign object combines a data frame and all the survey design information needed to analyse it.
# tg for triglycerides
~~~
{: .language-r}

# let's subset on age:

~~~
# merge25_df <- merge_df %>% filter((RIDAGEYR>=25 & RIDAGEYR<80)) 
# looks like filter doesn't work once you use svydesign so have to subset.
tg_design2 <- subset(tg_design, RIDAGEYR>=25 & 
                                RIDAGEYR<80) 
~~~
{: .language-r}

Variables of interest:
BMI, BP, LDL, TC, HDL, GLU, AGE,
-We are interested in the association between TC and BMI categories. (Total chol (TC) = outcome and glucose (main predictor))

1. After merging, first look at NAs and summaries of variables.

~~~
# Look at descriptive statistics of all independent variables
svymean(~RIDAGEYR, tg_design2, na.rm = TRUE) # RIDAGEYR Mean:49.24 SE:0.6123
