# Motivation

Now that we've clarified some of the reasons why we might be using R versus (or in addition to) other statistical software packages, let's get comfortable with the basic mechanics of using R in the RStudio environment.   After we learn the basics, we'll move on to the next lessons, where we'll read in data sets, explore them, analyze them, and create some data visualizations!

In the course of these lessons, we're going to learn some of the fundamentals of the R language, writing and running R code in RStudio, as well as some best practices for organizing code for scientific projects.


# Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

[Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
[Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

If you already have R and RStudio installed, you may want to make sure you have updated each of them to the latest version.  Sometimes there are slight differences in how they look or function, and using the latest versions will minimize differences between what you see on your screen versus what the instructor's screen shows.

# Introduction to RStudio

R is the **language** we'll be programming in, and RStudio is a popular software package that makes it easier for you to work in R, and which we'll be using in this workshop.  RStudio is a free, open source R [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or "IDE".  Most IDEs provide an editor for editing code, and facilities for running the code.  RStudio provides many extra features such as integration with version control and project management.

RStudio is available in several forms:
* [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop) is a desktop app you can install on your computer.  It is available for both Mac and Windows.
* [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a version of RStudio that you can access through your browser.  It does not run on your computer; rather, it runs on RStudio.com's servers.  While RStudio Cloud is currently free, there are limitations on how much memory your project can use.  RStudio plans to offer both free and paid plans in the future; the paid plans will probably offer more space and processing power.
* [RStudio Server](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server) is software that your organization would run on a server and individuals would access through their browsers, so you would interact with it much like how you would use RStudio Cloud.  RStudio Server has both free and paid versions; the paid version offers more features.

This course was written using RStudio Desktop.  If you're using RStudio Cloud or RStudio Server, most of the steps *should* be the same, but there may be differences in how you load data files into your RStudio environment.




# RStudio Basic layout

When you first open RStudio, you will see three panels:

  * The interactive R console (on the left side)
  * Environment/History (in the upper right, with multiple tabs)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (in the lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.  (Later we'll also see that the top left pane is also where we can look at data.)

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Using the Console versus working in an R or Rmd file.

Most of the time, your goal in working in RStudio is to develop an R program, or R Markdown file, that contains your analysis code and can be run from top to bottom.

Along the way, though, you might find it helpful to use the interactive R console to test things out or run small tests outside your program, and then perhaps copy some code into your R script.

The console allows you to type in a single R expression, and instantly see the result of evaluating the expression.  (This type of environment is often called a REPL or "Read, evaluate, print loop").

Advantages of using the console include the fact that it's quick and easy.  On the other hand, your steps aren't saved in the form of a program that you can rerun later.  (However, the History tab, in the upper right pane, can help you trace your steps in the console, to some extent).

You'll also notice later that when you run code in an R file, the code is executed within the Console window.

## Let's try the Console

The interactive console presents you with a `>` and a blinking cursor.  If you are familiar with the shell environment, it will feel somewhat similar to the shell in that there is a prompt waiting for you to enter an expression or command, and it instantly evaluates or executes what you typed in.  (Note that you may also have a "Terminal" tab in the lower left pane -- that is an actual shell environment you can access from within RStudio.)

Let's try entering an expression, using the R console as a very overwrought scientific calculator:

~~~
> 5.4 + 13
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
[1] 18.4
~~~
{: .output}

We'll learn soon what the `[1]` is meant to tell us.

What if we enter an incomplete expression?

~~~
> 34 - (4 *
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

The R console presents us with a `+`.  The `+` in this case has nothing to do with addition.  Rather, the `+` is indicating that the R console is waiting for you to complete the expression as a continuation of the first line.

At this point you have two options:
* Complete the expression
* Cancel out of entering the expression

In the example above, completing the expression might be done by entering something like `+ 2)`:

~~~
> 34 - (4 *
+ 2)
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
[1] 26
~~~
{: .output}

## Cancelling commands, replaying commands, auto-complete, and cleaning up

### Cancelling commands

If you want to **cancel** a command you can type either <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and RStudio will cancel the command and give you a fresh ">" prompt.

You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt and cancel a process that's running in the Console.  Another way to stop a process that's running in the RStudio console is to press the <img src="../fig/stop.png" style="display:inline-block; margin:0px" alt="stop" /> (Stop) button.


### Replaying commands

If you want to **reuse** a command that you recently ran in the RStudio console, you can hit the up and down arrows on your keyboard to scroll through your recent commands.

Your recent commands are also stored in the History tab, in the upper right pane.  You can highlight a command in the History, then click the <img src="../fig/to_console.png" style="display:inline-block; margin:0px" alt="To Console" height="20px" align="top" /> (To Console) button to copy the command to the Console, where you can then edit it and run it.

### Cleaning up

Sometimes the Console gets visually cluttered.  You can easily solve that using the <img src="../fig/broom.png" style="display:inline-block; margin:0px" alt="Broom" align="top" /> (broom) button.  The History tab also has a broom button, if you want to clear your command history.

### Autocomplete



## Running code from within the file editor

We've learned about running R code from the RStudio Console, but usually your objective is to write R code that you can

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command.




When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

```{r}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can simply look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. As well as providing a detailed description of
the command and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the
help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r}
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the 
same data type. For example

```{r}
1:5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x
```

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.


## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!

```{r}
ls
```

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

{: .callout}

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`
