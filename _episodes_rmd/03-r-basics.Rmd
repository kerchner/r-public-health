# Variables in R

We can use *variables* to store data that we can then reference.  A variable has a name, which is like a label, and a value.

Let's look at an R expression that assigns a value to a variable:

```{r}
height_cm <- 140
```

This statement has three parts:

* An assignment operator `<-` which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
* A variable name (`height_cm`)
* A value (`140`)

Let's take a look at what happened when you executed the statement `height_cm <- 140`.

In your Environment pane (usually in the upper right area of R Studio), you should now see a "Values" section.  This area is like a table of variable names and their values.  You should see `height_cm` listed with  a value of `140`.

If you now type the just name of the variable, `height_cm` at the console, R will **evaluate** the variable and print its current value.  Try it.

> ## Exercise 1
> 
> 1. Create a `height_inches` variable and set it to the value of `height_cm` divided by 2.54 (1 inch = 2.54 cm).
> 2. Then, change the value of `height_cm`.  Did `height_inches` recompute?  Why or why not?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. `height_inches <- height_cm / 2.54`
> > 2. `height_inches` does not recompute.  It was set to the _*value*_ of `height_cm` divided by 2.54, which is a number.  It's not actually a formula or function that's tied to the `height_cm` variable.  We'll get to functions later!

## Variable names

Different programming languages have slightly different rules around what characters may be used in variable names.  In R, both numbers and letters can be used, as well as a dot (`.`) and an underscore (`_`).

> ## Exercise
> 
> 1. Can you determine whether a variable name may start with a number?  Can a variable name start with a period or an underscore?
>
> 2. Why do you think R allows an underscore (`_`) but not a hyphen (`-`) in variable names?
>
> 3. Can you determine whether variable names are case-sensitive?

> > ## Solution

> > 1. something
> > 2. Something else
> > 3. And something else

## Variable Types

In our example above, the variables we used stored numeric values.  In real data, though, we have values that might be text, that might be true/false, might be empty, etc.

Let's try creating variables with values that are other types:

```{r}
study_id <- 'AB123X'
exposure <- TRUE
heart_rate <- NA
```



The idea here is that a variable not only stores data, but stores it as a particular type.

We can "ask" a variable what its type is, in R, using the `typeof()` function, like this:

```{r}
typeof(height_cm)
```

R tells us that `height_cm` is a "double".  What is a "double"?  A 



# Atomic vectors


## TODO: Logicals - counting up values
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE + TRUE
yields 4
so... you can do things like
df$x <- c(4, 6, 9, 1, 0)
sum(df$x > 5)
