## Variables in R

We can use *variables* to store data that we can then reference.  A variable has a name, which is like a label, and a value.

Let's look at an R expression that assigns a value to a variable:

```{r}
height_cm <- 140
```

This statement has several parts:

* An assignment operator `<-` which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
* A variable name (`height_cm`)
* A value (`140`)

Let's take a look at what happened.
