		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), is a multi-site longitudinal, epidemiologic study designed to examine the health of women during their middle years. The study examines the physical, biological, psychological and social changes during this transitional period. The goal of SWAN's research is to help scientists, health care providers and women learn how mid-life experiences affect health and quality of life during aging. Data were collected about doctor visits, medical conditions, medications, treatments, medical procedures, relationships, smoking, and menopause related information such as age at pre-, peri- and post-menopause, self-attitudes, feelings, and common physical problems associated with menopause. The study began in 1994. Between 2002 and 2004, 2,448 of the 3,302 women that joined SWAN were seen for their sixth follow-up visit. The research centers are located in the following communities: Ypsilanti and Inkster, MI (University of Michigan); Boston, MA (Massachusetts General Hospital); Chicago, IL (Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center); Alameda and Contra Costa County, CA (University of California-Davis and Kaiser Permanente); Los Angeles, CA (University of California-Los Angeles); Hackensack, NJ (Hackensack University Medical Center); and Pittsburgh, PA (University of Pittsburgh). SWAN participants represent five racial/ethnic groups and a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Demographic and background information includes age, language of interview, marital status, household composition, and employment.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Women age 40 through 55, living in designated geographic areas, with the ability to speak English or other designated languages (Japanese, Cantonese, or Spanish), who had the cognitive ability to provide verbal informed consent, and had membership in a specific site's targeted ethnic group were included within the first SWAN data collection.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Method of Data Collection:</strong> clinical data, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> face-to-face interview, self-enumerated questionnaire</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> Response rates: 16,065 completed the survey; 3,302 enrolled in the longitudinal survey; 2,881 completed the first follow-up visit; 2,748 completed the second follow-up visit; 2,710 completed the third follow-up visit; 2,679 completed the fourth follow-up visit; 2,617 completed the fifth follow-up visit; and 2,448 completed the sixth follow-up visit.</span></p>
